 For given reference in an object, there can be a path of names that leads to it.
 For example it can be an ivar, thus the path will consist of ivar name only:
 @[@"_myIvar"]

 But it also can be a reference in some nested struct like:
 struct Some_Struct {
   NSObject *myObject;
 };

 If that struct will be used in class, then name path would look like this:
 @[@"_myIvar", @"Some_Struct", @"myObject"]
