 Every block represents a filter that every reference must pass in order to be inspected.
 Reference will be described as relation from one object to another object. See definition of

 Invalid relations would be the relations that we are guaranteed are going to be broken at some point.
 Be careful though, it's not so straightforward to tell if the relation will be broken *with 100%
 certainty*, and if you'll filter out something that could otherwise show retain cycle that leaks -
 it would never be caught by detector.

 For examples of what are the relations that will be broken at some point check _FBStandardGraphEdgeFilters.mm

 If set to YES, then it will change from: `MallocBlock` to `<<MallocBlock:0xADDR>>`.
 You can then symbolicate the address to retrieve a symbol name which will look like:
 `__FOO_block_invoke` where FOO is replaced by the function creating the block.
 This will allow easier understanding of the code involved in the cycle when blocks are involved.
